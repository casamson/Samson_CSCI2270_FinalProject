# Samson_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
  This program works as an inventory for retail stores and fashion companies to display their design collection. Fashion companies and designers (Gucci, Ralph Lauren, etc.) can work with department stores like Macy's and Dillard's and use this program in order to build an inventory for their designs and available clothing. The user will enter the piece that they desire; then, the program will then search through the inventory to see if it has any matching items. The inventory will be built of trees and linked lists, linking all the categories together. For example, one can search for a type of clothing - a dress, and then filter by category all of the different choices from there. The user can choose the color, length, style, designer, etc. and tailor the piece of clothing to what they want. If an exact match cannot be found, then the program will return a myriad of designs that are similar to the one they were looking for. This program assumes that all sizes are present and that the range of prices are already accounted for.
